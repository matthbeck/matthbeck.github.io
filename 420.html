<p><b>Course objectives.</b>
Math 420/720 gives an introduction to fundamental combinatorial objects, their uses in other fields of mathematics and its applications, and
their analysis. 
We will learn how to use combinatorial structures to represent mathematical and applied questions and will become comfortable with the
combinatorial tools commonly used to analyze such structures. 
Given a hypothetical combinatorial object that must satisfy certain properties, we will learn how to prove the existence or non-existence of
the object, compute the number of such objects, and understand their underlying structure.

</p>

<p>
<b>The math.</b>
The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
One doesn't become a good piano player by listening to good music, and one doesn't learn how to
shoot free throws by watching basketball games.
Similarly, you don't learn mathematics by watching someone else do mathematics. You will be doing a
lot of the math in this course.
It is vital and expected that you attend every class meeting. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
</p>

<p><b>Axioms & first principles.</b>
Our class is based on <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardila</a>'s Axioms:
<ol>
  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
  <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</ol>
I would add to the last point that dignity and respect is also something you should treat yourself
to, and that every person in our course, students and professor, are expected to be honest.
It is likely that some or all of us will experience challenges and disruptions this semester. Please
choose to act with compassion for others and for yourself as we navigate any situations that arise.
</p>

<p><b>Homework.</b>
I will assign homework problems as we go through the material. You may (and should) work together
with your class mates. 
You may not search the internet for solutions to problems; we will use our creativity,
course texts, and peer collaboration as our tools.
We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class, and you can
hand in (or bring to my office hours) any of your solutions for feedback. 
We will have a homework quiz every Wednesday at the beginning of class, in which you will be asked one definition and one problem given in the previous week. 
We will have three cumulative quizzes, on the following Wednesdays:
<ul>
  <li><a href="420/test1.pdf">26 February</a></li>
  <li>2 April</li>
  <li>30 April</li>
</ul>
</p>

I want to ensure that each of you accomplishes the goals of this course as comfortably and successfully as possible. 
At any time you feel overwhelmed or lost, please come and talk with me.

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

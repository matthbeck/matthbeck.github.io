"I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime."

<p>
Like most professionals, I get way too many emails.
Before sending me one, please consider the following guidelines, adapted from the quite-helpful book <i>The Tyranny of E-mail</i> by John Freeman:

<ul>

<li>Think twice before sending an email, including replies and copies.

<li>Try my office phone (415.405.3473) or skype (beckmath) instead of email.

<li>I will reply to your email (but most likely not instantly), except when I found your language inappropriate.

</ul>

<p>
I do not participate in "social" networks like <i>Facebook</i> or <i>LinkedIn</i>, so please do not waste your time with invitations to "befriend" me. (Try instead friendly face-to-face conversation over a good cup of coffee.)

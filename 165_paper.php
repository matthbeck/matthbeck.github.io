  <p>MATH 165</p>
  <p>Concepts of the Number System</p>
  </b>
  <p>Fall 2012</p>
  <p>Term Paper</p>

<p>
The term paper is a project you will be working on throughout the semester. The topic is up to you but needs to be checked with me. Topics could be anything from the history of a mathematical concept to a current issue in math education. I expect that you will have found a topic by the end of September. A first draft is due on October 29. You will correct each other's drafts; the corrections are due on November 5. The final version of your paper is due on December 14; you will need to turn it in on <a href="http://ilearn.sfsu.edu/">iLearn</a>. As with your homework, you may hand in your paper early to be able to get feedback from me.

<p>

Here is a list of possible topics, but you should feel free to come up with your own ideas. The references are meant to provide starting points for your research.

<ul>

  <li>Reasoning and fallacies in fundamental mathematics taught in elementary school (L. Ma, <cite>Knowing and teaching elementary mathematics</cite>; choose one chapter to write about).
  
  <li>How to define fractions in grade school (R. McCrory, <cite><a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/fea-mccrory.pdf">Mathematicians and mathematics
textbooks for prospective elementary teachers</a></cite>, Notices of the AMS, 53 (2006), pp. 20-29)
  
  <li>Learning and teaching proofs (G. Harel & L. Sowder, <cite><a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~harel/Downloadable/TowardComprehensivePerspective.pdf">Toward comprehensive perspectives on the learning and teaching of proof</a></cite>; G. Hanna, <cite>Proofs that prove and proofs that explain</cite>. In: G. Vergnaud, J. Rogalski, and M. Artigue (Eds.), Proceedings of the 13th Meeting of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education (pp. 45-51), PME, 1989)
  
  <li>Mathematical literacy (R. P. Moses, <cite>Radical equations</cite>, Beacon Press 2001; J. A. Paulos, <cite>Innumeracy</cite>, Vintage 1990).
  
  <li>Ethnomathematics (start with any of the books by <a href="http://www.math.binghamton.edu/zaslav/cz.biblio.html">Claudia Zaslavsky</a>).
  
  <li>History of number systems (H.-D. Ebbinghaus et al, <cite>Numbers</cite>, Springer-Verlag, 1990; B. Mazur, <cite>Imagining numbers</cite>, Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2003).

  <li>History of certain numbers, e.g., 0 (C. Seife, <cite>Zero</cite>, Viking, 2000).
  
  <li><a href="http://mathforum.org/teachers/">The Math Forum Teachers' Place</a> (concentrate on a specific activity or lesson plan)

Among the core ideas in mathematics are: integer, induction,
algorithm, real number, rational
number, modular arithmetic, limit, and uncountable sets. And among the
core methods of
mathematics are: axiom, theorem, and proof.  <i>The Art Of Proof</i>
uses the one to teach
the other.  Rather than teaching proof tactics in the abstract, they
are taught in the course of
discussing interesting topics.  Logic, set theory, and methods of proof
are slipped in as needed.

<p>

<i>The Art Of Proof</i> is a textbook for a one-semester or two-quarter
course.  A typical student will
have studied calculus (perhaps also linear algebra) with reasonable
success.   The book may also
be helpful to some older students of mathematics: high-school
teachers, scientists and social
scientists who find that the mathematics they studied at college is no
longer sufficient for their
needs. A mathematically precocious high school student should also be
able to get an early start by
reading this book.

<p>

The authors take the position that the student knows a significant
amount: they call this
knowledge "Sesame Street through Calculus."  With an artful mixture of
chatty style and
interesting examples, the student's previous intuitive knowledge is
placed on solid intellectual
ground. The book puts the instructor in control: some proofs are
presented in detail, but the
instructor decides which of the omitted proofs to present in class and
which should challenge the
student to discover a proof and write it down correctly.

<p>

<i>The Art of Proof</i> is divided into two parts, The Discrete--dealing with integers, induction,
modular arithmetic and algorithms--and The Continuous--dealing
with real and rational numbers
and with countability.  The authors assume/hope/recommend that these
two parts will be given
equal time in the course. The book also includes a series of short
essays on topics not
covered in the main text, topics suitable for seminar-style
presentation by small teams of
students, either in class or in a mathematics club setting. These
include: continuity,
cryptography, groups, graphs, complex numbers, ordinal number and
generating functions.

<b>Excerpts from Reviews</b>

<p>

"This book offers an approach well-balanced between rigor and clarifying simplification. <i>Dilbert</i> and <i>Foxtrot</i> cartoons with philosophical quotes presage the introduction of axioms and preliminary propositions. This graceful and witty blend succeeds well in a textbook for a post-calculus course transitioning a student to higher mathematics. <i>The Art of Proof</i> can also well serve independent readers looking for a solitary path to a vista on higher mathematics. I wish that as a high school student with a single semester of calculus behind me I had discovered this book and taken it in and then taken it with me on my university journeys.

At well under two hundred pages, this text seems to be light and cursory. But do not let that belie the depth of content contained therein. There is thoroughness and breadth to this work."

<p>

"This qualitative transition presents a most acute pedagogical challenge. [...] This book does feature definite mathematical content, contrasting with works that aim at decoupling purely logical apparatus from strictly mathematical concerns. [...] The authors write with the authority of research mathematicians and clearly mean to open that avenue to students. Summing Up: Recommended." (D. V. Feldman, <i>Choice</i>, Vol. 48 (8), April 2011)

"Logic moves in one direction, the direction of clarity, coherence and structure. Ambiguity moves in the other direction, that of fluidity, openness, and release. Mathematics moves back and forth between these two poles. [...] It is the interaction between these different aspects that gives mathematics its power."
<br>William Byers (<i>How Mathematicians Think</i>, Princeton University Press, 2007)

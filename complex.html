<h2>A First Course in Complex Analysis</h2><p>

<p>
<A HREF="index.html">Matthias Beck</a>, Gerald Marchesi, <A HREF="http://people.math.binghamton.edu/dennis/">Dennis Pixton</A>, and Lucas Sabalka<p>

<p> 
<i>A First Course in Complex Analysis</i> was written for a one-semester undergraduate course developed
at <A HREF="http://www.math.binghamton.edu/">Binghamton University (SUNY)</a> and <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu">San Francisco
    State University</a>, and has been adopted at <a href="complexadoption.html">several other institutions</a>. 
For many of our students, Complex Analysis is their first rigorous analysis (if not mathematics) class they take, and this book reflects this very much. We tried to rely on as few concepts from Real Analysis as possible. In particular, series and sequences are treated from scratch, which has the consequence that power series are introduced late in the course. The goal our book works toward is the Residue Theorem, including some nontraditional applications from both continuous and discrete mathematics. More than 250 exercises and numerous <i>SageMath</i> prompts are spread throughout the text.

<p> 
<i>A First Course in Complex Analysis</i> is an open textbook available in online and pdf formats, as well as in paperback printed by
<a href="http://orthogonalpublishing.com/">Orthogonal Publishing</a> (also available from your favorite
bookseller; make sure you order the current version 1.6).

Our book is featured in the <a href="http://aimath.org/textbooks/">Open Textbook Initiative</a> by the <a href="http://aimath.org/">American Institute of
    Mathematics</a>.
We would be happy to hear from anyone who has adopted our book for their course, as well as suggestions, corrections, or other comments.

"First, it is neccessary to study the facts, to multiply the number of observations, and then later to search for
formulas that connect them so as thus to discern the particular laws governing a certain class of phenomena.
In general, it is not until after these particular laws have been established that one can expect to discover
and articulate the more general laws that complete theories by bringing a multitude of apparently very diverse
phenomena together under a single governing principle."
<br>Augustin Louis Cauchy

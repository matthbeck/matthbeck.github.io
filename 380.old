Our goal is to study the calculus of functions in one complex variable. That is, we will look at concepts of real-variable functions and see which of these concepts and their accompanying theorems can be transferred into the complex realm, which have to be modified, and which don't exist in the world of complex numbers. We will see that there are concepts and theorems in all of these three categories.
Topics we will study include complex numbers and functions, differentiation, integration, 
Cauchy's theorem and its consequences, harmonic functions, power and Laurent series, and residues.

I want to ensure that each of you accomplishes the goals of this course as comfortably and successfully as possible. 
At any time you feel overwhelmed or lost, please come and talk with me.

<p>

<b>Homework</b>: I will <a href="380_hw.html">assign homework problems</a> as we go
through the material. You may (and should) work together with your class mates. We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class, and
you can hand any of your solutions for feedback. We will have a homework quiz every
Monday at the beginning of class, in which you will be asked one definition and one
problem given in the previous week.

<p>

<b>Quizzes</b>: I will frequently check your progress through unannounced quizzes given at the beginning of class. A quiz will typically test your concept of a certain definition or concept. There will be no make-up quizzes. At the end of the semester, I will drop the lowest of your quiz grades.

<p>

The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
It is vital and expected that you attend every lecture. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
The <a href="http://ilearn.sfsu.edu">iLearn</a> system allows you to send emails to anybody in your class. 
<a href="http://ilearn.sfsu.edu">iLearn</a> also features an online discussion board.
Contact each other and work together.

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

    "I believe that numbers and functions of Analysis are not the arbitrary result of our minds; I think that they exist outside of us, with the same character of necessity as the things of objective reality, and we meet them or discover them, and study them, as do the physicists, the chemists and the zoologists."

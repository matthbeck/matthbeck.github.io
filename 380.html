<p><b>Course objectives.</b>
Our goal is to study the calculus of functions in one complex variable. That is, we will look at concepts of real-variable functions and see which of these concepts and their accompanying theorems can be transferred into the complex realm, which have to be modified, and which don't exist in the world of complex numbers. We will see that there are concepts and theorems in all of these three categories. 
</p>

<p><b>Syllabus.</b> 
Topics in this course will include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>complex numbers and functions
<li>differentiation
<li>integration
<li>Cauchy's theorem and its consequences
<li>power and Laurent series
<li>residues
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Textbook.</b> 
M. Beck, G. Marchesi, D. Pixton, and L. Sabalka, <a href="complex.html">A First Course in
Complex Analysis</a>, version 1.54 (2018).
</p>

<p>
<b>The math.</b>
The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
One doesn't become a good piano player by listening to good music, and one doesn't learn how to
shoot free throws by watching basketball games.
Similarly, you don't learn mathematics by watching someone else do mathematics. You will be doing a
lot of the math in this course.
It is vital and expected that you attend every class meeting. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
</p>

<p><b>Axioms & first principles.</b>
Our class is based on <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardila</a>'s Axioms:
<ol>
  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
  <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</ol>
I would emphasize within the last axiom that dignity and respect is also something you should treat yourself
to, and that every person in our course, students and professor, are expected to be honest.
It is likely that some or all of us will experience challenges and disruptions this semester. Please
choose to act with compassion for others and for yourself as we navigate any situations that arise.
</p>

<p><b>Homework.</b>
I will assign homework problems as we go through the material. You may (and should) work together
with your class mates. 
You may not search the internet for solutions to problems; we will use our creativity,
course texts, and peer collaboration as our tools.
We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class, and you can
hand in (or bring to my office hours) any of your solutions for feedback. 
The homework problems from any given week will be due before the following Monday class. You can
either bring your homework to class or send me a pdf copy via email. 
</p>

<p><b>Sage.</b>
You will be expected to use the <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/">open math software sage</a> in some of your homework assignments.
<a href="http://www.sageforundergraduates.org/">Here is a good introduction to sage</a>.
I will add useful sage commands <a href="380sage.txt">for our class here</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Grading system.</b>
In our course, we will use a <i>specifications-based</i> assessment and grading system, which has
the following key features:
<ul>
  <li>There are four elements to assessment and grading: participation, homework, and exams with
definition and problem sections.</li>
  <li>There are no points and no partial credit; all assignments will be either be given a 
<i>pass</i> or an <i>incomplete</i>. This grade, for each problem, will be based on a combination
of (a) correctness of the solution and (b) quality of communication in your writing.</li>
  <li>Your class grade will be determined by the amount of course material you have passed, with 
the requirements to achieve each letter grade specified below. By focusing on learning and mastery 
instead of accruing points, we can keep our attention focused on what we know and where we need to 
improve.</li>
  <li>You can revise some of your incomplete work. My goal is for each of you to develop
as mathematical thinkers, learners, and collaborators. To support this goal, you are allowed
to revise and resubmit selected work during the semester.</li>
</ul>
The four elements of assessment and grading are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>Participation: I expect you to be present and engaged every class session. Every student
begins the semester with a participation grade of 20 and will lose one point for each unexcused
absence.</li>
  <li>Homework: On non-exam Mondays, you will submit five homework problems, assigned the previous
week. You will be allowed to revise and resubmit them (once) within a week of when I return your work.</li>
  <li>Exams: we will have five cumulative exams, on
    <ul>
      <li><a href="380/test1.pdf">17 February</a></li>
      <li><a href="380/test2.pdf">10 March</a></li>
      <li>7 April</li>
      <li>28 April</li>
      <li>19 May</li>
    </ul>
    Each exam will consist of three definitions and three problems similar to the homework. You
will be allowed to revise and resubmit selected problems (once) within a week of when I return your work.
  </li>
</ul>
To earn a particular grade in the class, you need to complete all of the requirements in the
column corresponding to that grade in the table below; i.e., if the entry lists X then you need to
receive a <i>pass</i> grade on X of those items to earn the corresponding column grade.

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

"I believe that numbers and functions of Analysis are not the arbitrary result of our minds; I think that they exist outside of us, with the same character of necessity as the things of objective reality, and we meet them or discover them, and study them, as do the physicists, the chemists and the zoologists."

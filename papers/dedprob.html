<i>Abstract.</i> Higher-dimensional Dedekind sums are defined as a
generalization of a recent 1-dimensional probability model of
Dilcher and Girstmair to a d-dimensional cube. The analysis of
the frequency distribution of marked lattice points leads to new
formulae in certain special cases, and to new bounds for the
classical Dedekind sums. Upper bounds for the generalized Dedekind
sums are defined in terms of 1-dimensional moments. In the
classical two-dimensional case, the ratio of these sums to their
upper bounds are cosines of angles between certain vectors of
n-dimensional cones, conjectured to have a largest spacial angle
of pi/6.

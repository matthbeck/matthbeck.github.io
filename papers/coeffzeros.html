<i>Abstract.</i> The Ehrhart polynomial of a convex lattice polytope counts
integer points in integral dilates of the polytope. We present new
linear inequalities satisfied by the coefficients of Ehrhart
polynomials and relate them to known inequalities. We also
investigate the roots of Ehrhart polynomials. We prove that for
fixed d, there exists a bounded region of <b>C</b> containing all roots of
Ehrhart polynomials of d-polytopes, and that all real roots of these
polynomials lie in [-d, [d/2]). In contrast, we prove that when the
dimension d is not fixed the positive real roots can be arbitrarily large.  
We finish with an experimental investigation of the Ehrhart polynomials
of cyclic polytopes and 0/1-polytopes.

<i>Abstract.</i> We use the residue theorem to derive an expression for the number of lattice points 
in a dilated n-dimensional tetrahedron with vertices 
at lattice points on each coordinate axis and the origin. 
This expression is known as the Ehrhart polynomial. 
We show that it is a polynomial in t, where t is the integral dilation parameter. 
We prove the Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity law for these tetrahedra, relating the Ehrhart 
polynomials of the interior and the closure of the tetrahedra. To illustrate 
our method, we compute the Ehrhart coefficient for codimension 2. Finally, 
we show how our ideas can be used to compute the Ehrhart polynomial for an 
arbitrary convex lattice polytope.

<i>Abstract.</i> Sperner's bound on the size of an antichain in the lattice 
P(S) of subsets of a finite set S has been generalized in three different 
directions: by Erdos to subsets of P(S) in which chains contain at most r 
elements; by Meshalkin to certain classes of compositions of S; 
by Griggs, Stahl, and Trotter through replacing the antichains by certain sets 
of pairs of disjoint elements of P(S). 
We unify Erdos's, Meshalkin's, and Griggs-Stahl-Trotter's inequalities with 
a common generalization.  We similarly unify their LYM companions.

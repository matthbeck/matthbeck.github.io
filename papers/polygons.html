<i>Abstract.</i> We give explicit, polynomial-time computable formulas for 
the number of integer points in any two-dimensional rational polygon. A rational polygon 
is one whose vertices have rational coordinates.  
We find that the basic building blocks of our formulas 
are <i>Dedekind-Rademacher sums</i>, which are polynomial-time computable finite Fourier series. 
As a by-product we rederive a reciprocity law for 
these sums due to Gessel, which generalizes the reciprocity law for the classical Dedekind sums. 
In addition, our approach shows that Gessel's reciprocity law is a special case of the one for  
Dedekind-Rademacher sums, due to Rademacher.

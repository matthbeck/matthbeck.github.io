<i>Abstract.</i> In <A HREF="closer.html"><i>A Closer Look at Lattice Points in Rational Simplices</i></a>, 
the author generalized Ehrhart's idea of counting 
lattice points in dilated rational polytopes: Given a rational polytope, that is, a 
polytope with rational vertices, we use its description as the intersection of 
halfspaces, which determine the facets of the polytope. Instead of just a single 
dilation factor, we allow different dilation factors for each of these facets. We proved 
that, if our polytope is a simplex, the
lattice point counts in the interior and closure of such a <i>vector-dilated</i> simplex
are quasipolynomials satisfying an Ehrhart-type reciprocity law. This generalizes the classical
Ehrhart-Macdonald reciprocity law for rational polytopes.
In the present paper we complete the picture by proving a similar result for general rational polytopes. 
As a corollary, we also generalize a reciprocity theorem of Stanley.

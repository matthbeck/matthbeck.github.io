<b>A Closer Look at Lattice Points in Rational Simplices</b><p>

<i>Abstract.</i> We generalize Ehrhart's idea of counting lattice points in 
dilated rational polytopes: Given a rational simplex, that is, an n-dimensional polytope 
with n+1 rational vertices, we use its description as the intersection of n+1 halfspaces, 
which determine the facets of the simplex. Instead of just a single dilation factor, we allow 
different dilation factors for each of these facets. We give an elementary proof that the 
lattice point counts in the interior and closure of such a 'vector-dilated simplex' 
are quasipolynomials satisfying an Ehrhart-type reciprocity law. This generalizes the classical 
reciprocity law for rational polytopes. 
As an example, we derive a lattice point count formula for a rectangular rational 
triangle, which enables us to compute the number of lattice points inside any rational polygon.

<b>Dedekind sums: a combinatorial-geometric viewpoint</b><p>

<i>Abstract.</i> The literature on Dedekind sums is vast.  In this expository
paper we show that there is
a common thread to many generalizations of Dedekind sums, namely through the
study of lattice point enumeration of rational polytopes.
In particular, there are some natural finite Fourier series which we call
<b>Fourier-Dedekind sums</b>, and which form the building blocks of the number
of partitions of an integer from a finite set of positive integers.   This problem
also goes by the name of the `coin exchange problem'.
Dedekind sums have enjoyed a resurgence of interest recently, from such diverse
fields as
topology, number theory, and combinatorial geometry.
The Fourier-Dedekind sums we study here include as special cases  generalized
Dedekind sums studied by Berndt, Carlitz, Grosswald, Knuth, Rademacher, and
Zagier.   Our interest in these sums stems from
the appearance of Dedekind's and Zagier's sums in lattice point count formulas
for polytopes.
Using some simple generating functions, we show that generalized Dedekind sums
are natural
ingredients for such formulas. As immediate 'geometric' corollaries to our formulas,
we obtain and generalize reciprocity laws of Dedekind,
Zagier, and Gessel.   Finally, we prove a polynomial-time
complexity result for Zagier's higher dimensional Dedekind sums.

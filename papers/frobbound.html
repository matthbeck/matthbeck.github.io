<i>Abstract.</i> We study the Frobenius problem: given relatively prime positive integers 
a_1,...,a_d, find the largest value of t (the Frobenius number g(a_1,...,a_d)) 
such that 

<P><center> t = m_1 a_1 + ... + m_n a_n . </center><p>

has no  solution in nonnegative integers m_1,...,m_d. We introduce a method to compute upper bounds for g(a_1,a_2,a_3), 
which seem to grow considerably slower than previously known bounds. 
Our computations are based on a formula for the restricted partition function, which involves 
Dedekind-Rademacher sums, and the reciprocity law for these sums.

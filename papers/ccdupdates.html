Page 11, Theorem 1.5: What we call "Popoviciu's theorem" should really be called the "Barlow-Popoviciu theorem", since Peter Barlow's
<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/An_elementary_investigation_of_the_theor.html?id=Jj9KAAAAMAAJ">1811 number theory book</a>
(p. 323-325) contains a result that is easily seen to be equivalent to Theorem 1.5. [Thanks to Pieter Moree for bringing Barlow's book to
our attention.]<p> 

Page 35: In Theorem 2.5, we need to assume that <i>d</i> > 1 (because Equation (2.10) only holds for <i>d</i> > 1).<p> 

Pages 36: In the definition of a bipyramid over <i>Q</i>, we need to assume that the origin is contained in <i>Q</i>.<p> 

Page 77, Exercise 3.12: Delta(d,1) and Delta(d,d-1) are not equal (though they are both regular simplices).<p>

Page 79, Exercise 3.30: the difference on the right-hand side should be a sum.<p> 

Page 88: Matthew Fiset and Alexander Kasprzyk proved a rational version Hibi's palindromic theorem (Theorem 4.6) in <a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/">Electronic Journal of Combinatorics</a> 15(1), 2008, Note 18.<p>  

Page 91: Open Problem 4.14 has been <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.3667">solved by Christian Haase, Benjamin Nill, and Sam Payne</a>.<p>

Page 102, Exercise 5.10: here we need to assume that <i>P</i> is simple.<p> 

Page 150, Corollary 8.12: the formulas for the h*-coefficients are not correct.<p>

Page 157, second paragraph: "vector space" needs to be replaced by "<b>Z</b>-module."
The same applies to the hint for Exercise 3.13 on page 206.<p>

Page 160, Section 9.4: in our "second proof of Theorem 3.23," the case r=0 needs to be treated separately.<p> 

Page 180 & 182, Examples 11.1 & 11.3: each of the cos<sup>-1</sup>(1/sqrt(3)) is missing a factor of 1/(2 pi).<p>

Page 190: Open Problem 11.14 has been <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0707.1825">solved by Steven Sam</a>.<p>

Page 208, hint for Exercise 9.2: the big union in the sixth line should be a big intersection.<p>

The links to the math biographies at St. Andrews have unfortunately changed. "Biographies/" needs to be replaced by "Mathematicians/".<p>

<i>Abstract.</i> The existence of an integral flow polynomial that counts nowhere-zero k-flows on a graph, due to Kochol, is a consequence of a general theory of inside-out polytopes.  The same holds for flows on signed graphs.  We develop these theories, as well as the related counting theory of nowhere-zero flows on a signed graph with values in an abelian group of odd order.

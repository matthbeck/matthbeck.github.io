<p><b>Course objectives.</b>
Linear algebra is motivated by solving system of linear equations. Despite this
simple starting point, linear algebra plays deep and profound roles in both
applied and "pure" mathematics, as well as many other fields such as computer
science, data analysis, the natural sciences, economics, etc.
Our course will start with systems of linear equations and techniques of
finding their solutions based on row operations and Gaussian elimination. This
will naturally lead us to matrix algebra operation and abstract vector space
notions. Representation of  linear transformations by matrices and change of
basis will be introduced with an eye towards diagonalization, and inner
products will be used as a gateway to symmetric positive (semi-)definite
matrices. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be introduced with applications of
diagonalization in mind. We will conclude with spectral
decomposition/factorization of symmetric matrices and singular value decomposition and its applications.

</p>

<p><b>Syllabus.</b> 
Topics in this course will include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Solution of system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination
<li>Matrix algebra, special matrices (diagonal, triangular, symmetric), matrix inverse and transpose
<li>Abstract vector spaces and main examples (<b>R</b><sup>n</sup>, matrix and polynomial spaces, function spaces)
<li>Linear dependence/independence, subspaces, their bases and dimension, rank
<li>Linear transformations of vector spaces,matrix representations, change of basis 
<li>Range and kernel of linear transformations, finding their bases, rank-nullity theorem
<li>Real inner product spaces and positive (semi-)definite matrices, inner products on function spaces
<li>Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities
<li>Orthogonality, orthogonal bases, orthogonal projections, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
<li>Determinants 
<li>Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, eigenspaces and their bases
<li>Diagonalization and spectral factorization of symmetric matrices
<li>Singular value decomposition and applications
</ul>

<p>
<b>Texts.</b>
We will follow (selected sections from) two books:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~olver/">Peter J. Olver</a> & <a

<p>
<b>The math.</b>
The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
One doesn't become a good piano player by listening to music, and one doesn't learn how to
shoot free throws by watching basketball games.
Similarly, you don't learn mathematics by watching someone else do mathematics. You will be doing a
lot of the math in this course.
It is vital and expected that you attend every class meeting. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
</p>

<p><b>Axioms & first principles.</b>
Our class is based on <a href="https://fardila.com/">Federico Ardila</a>'s Axioms:
<ol>
  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
  <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</ol>
I would emphasize within the last axiom that dignity and respect is also something you should treat yourself
to, and that every person in our course, students and professor, are expected to be honest.
It is likely that some of us will experience challenges and disruptions this semester. Please
choose to act with compassion for others and for yourself as we navigate any situations that arise.
</p>

<p><b>Human connectivity.</b>
Our class relies heavily on human interaction (among students and between students and the professor).
I expect you to be present and engaged in every class session, work with classmates, and share your ideas as part of our course community. 
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/leave-your-laptops-at-the-door-to-my-classroom.html">Research shows</a> that use of cell phones, laptops, and other devices causes distraction and impairs learning not
only for the person using the technology but also for people nearby. Consequently, you may not use technology
of this kind during class sessions. (If you have accommodation needs around technology that have been
registered with DPRC, please let me know.)
</p>

<p><b>Homework & AI policy.</b>
I will assign homework problems as we go through the material. The main point of homework is for you to
continuously flex and strengthen your math muscles.
You may (and should) work together with your class mates. 
You may not search the internet or use AI tools for solutions to problems; we will use our creativity, course texts, and peer collaboration as our tools: we will learn math by doing math.
We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class, and you can
hand in (or bring to my office hours) any of your solutions for feedback. 
The homework problems from any given week will be due before the following Wednesday class. You can
either bring your homework to class or send me a pdf copy via email (please use your first name as file
name). 
</p>

<p><b>SageMath.</b>
We will use <a href="https://www.sagemath.org/">SageMath</a> in class, and you may (and should)
use it outside of our class sessions, too.
<a href="http://www.sageforundergraduates.org/">Here is a good introduction to sage</a>.
I have collected a few useful sage commands <a href="325sage.txt">for our class here</a>.

<p><b>Grading system.</b>
In our course, we will use a <i>specifications-based</i> assessment and grading system, which has
the following key features:
<ul>
  <li>There are four elements to assessment and grading: participation, homework, and exams with
definition and problem sections.</li>
  <li>There are no points and no partial credit; all assignments will be either be given a 
<i>pass</i> or an <i>incomplete</i>. This grade, for each problem, will be based on a combination
of (a) correctness of the solution and (b) quality of communication in your writing.</li>
  <li>Your class grade will be determined by the amount of course material you have passed, with 
the benchmarks to achieve each letter grade specified below. By focusing on learning and mastery 
instead of accruing partial credits, we can keep our attention focused on what we know and where we need to 
improve.</li>
  <li>You can revise some of your incomplete work. My goal is for each of you to develop
as mathematical thinkers, learners, and collaborators. To support this goal, you are allowed
to revise and resubmit selected work during the semester.</li>
</ul>
The four elements of assessment and grading are as follows.
<ul>
  <li>Participation: I expect you to be present and engaged every class session. Every student
begins the semester with a participation grade of 20 and will lose one point for each unexcused
absence.</li>
  <li>Homework: On non-exam Wednesdays, you will submit three homework problems, assigned the previous
week. You will be allowed to revise and resubmit them (once) by the following Wednesday.</li>
  <li>Exams: we will have four cumulative exams, on
    <ul>
      <li>18 February (in class)</li>
      <li>18 March (in class)</li>
      <li>22 April (in class)</li>
      <li>18 May (2:45 pm)</li>
    </ul>
    Each exam will consist of three linear algebra definitions with examples and three problems similar to the homework. You will be allowed to revise and resubmit selected problems (once) within a week of when I return your work.
  </li>
</ul>
To earn a particular grade in the class, you need to complete all of the benchmarks in the
column corresponding to that grade in the table below; i.e., if the entry lists x then you need to
receive a <i>pass</i> grade on x of those items to earn the corresponding column grade.

</p>

<p><b>Academic integrity and plagiarism.</b>
<a href="http://conduct.sfsu.edu/plagiarism">Academic integrity</a>, the ethical presentation of one's own
work in accordance with the rules established for this class, is required. Instances of academic misconduct
will be reported to the College in which the course is housed, the Division of Graduate Studies (if a graduate
student), and the Office of Student Conduct with the report being kept in those offices until a student earns
their degree. Any instances of cheating, deceit, fabrication, forgery, plagiarism, unauthorized altering of records or submitting false documents, unauthorized collaboration, unauthorized submission of work previously given credit, or other forms of academic misconduct will be assigned a grade penalty, likely a grade of zero. Failing one or more assignments or examinations for reasons of academic integrity violations may result in a final class grade of F. Students may not withdraw from classes in which they have committed academic misconduct. Consequences for violations of academic integrity may exceed an F on the assignment, examination, or class as determined by the Academic Integrity Review Committee.
</p>
<p>
Members of our academic community have a responsibility to develop an awareness of academic integrity, to cultivate skills to realize honesty in academic and community work, and to sustain actively academic honor as a core value of our community. Students are expected to engage in behaviors that reflect well upon the university. In addition to attending to one's own actions, the Standards for Student Conduct require that students who witness academic dishonesty notify their faculty/instructor, department chair, or the Office of Student Conduct. Supporting academic integrity enhances the reputation of the university and the value attributed to degrees awarded by the university.
</p>

<p><b>Course content capturing.</b>
Students may not capture audio, photos or video from class sessions on their own devices without the explicit permission of the instructor and everyone present, unless part of a DPRC-authorized accommodation.
Students may not post any course materials to any third-party sites or post any recordings, screenshots, audio
or chat transcripts in any setting outside the class. Violations of this policy are subject to student disciplinary action.

<p><b>CR/NCR grading.</b>
Most Mathematics classes allow CR/NCR grading, but many majors--including Mathematics--do not count CR/NCR grades towards the major. Mathematics majors should not take their Mathematics classes CR/NCR. All other majors should check with their academic advisors before deciding to take a Mathematics class CR/NCR.
If--after checking with your advisor--you want to apply for CR/NCR grading, you should log onto <A HREF="https://www.sfsu.edu/online/login.htm">this web site</A> and sign up for CR/NCR grading before the <A HREF="https://webapps.sfsu.edu/public/webcal/acadcalendar">deadline</A>. I will not pass out a CR/NCR sheet in class.
</p>

<p><b>Incomplete grades.</b>
The Incomplete grade (I) is assigned only to students doing satisfactory work until the last few weeks of a
course, when events beyond the students' control prevented them from completing the course. If this happens to
you, please discuss with me the possibility of taking an Incomplete rather than withdrawing from a class that you cannot finish.  If you would like me to consider an Incomplete, be proactive: approach me as soon as you realize you will not be able to finish the class, and be prepared to present me with a plan how you intend to make up your Incomplete. 
</p>

<p><b>Late and retroactive withdrawals.</b>
Petitions for withdrawal from a class after the <A HREF="https://webapps.sfsu.edu/public/webcal/acadcalendar">deadline</A>, either before the end of the semester (late withdrawal) or after the semester ends (retroactive withdrawal) must be justified by events that occurred after the deadline. In general, only petitions for withdrawal from all courses will be approved. Late withdrawal from your math course alone is usually not approved. 
</p>

<p><b>This syllabus is subject to change.</b>
I will try to keep this course web page as updated as possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find out what's going on. Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

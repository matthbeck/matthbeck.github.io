<p><b>Course objectives.</b>
Linear algebra is motivated by solving system of linear equations. Despite this
simple starting point, linear algebra plays deep and profound roles in both
applied and "pure" mathematics, as well as many other fields such as computer
science, data analysis, the natural sciences, economics, any many more.
Our course will start with systems of linear equations and techniques of
finding their solutions based on row operations and Gaussian elimination. This
will naturally lead us to matrix algebra operation and abstract vector space
notions. Representation of  linear transformations by matrices and change of
basis will be introduced with an eye towards diagonalization, and inner
products will be used as a gateway to symmetric positive (semi-)definite
matrices. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors will be introduced with applications of
diagonalization in mind. We will conclude with spectral
decomposition/factorization of symmetric matrices and singular value decomposition and its applications.

</p>

<p><b>Syllabus.</b> 
Topics in this course will include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Solution of system of linear equations using Gaussian elimination
<li>Matrix algebra, special matrices (diagonal, triangular, symmetric), matrix inverse and transpose
<li>Abstract vector spaces and main examples (<b>R</b><sup>n</sup>, matrix and polynomial spaces, function spaces)
<li>Linear dependence/independence, subspaces, their bases and dimension (rank)
<li>Linear transformations of vector spaces,matrix representations, change of basis 
<li>Range and kernel of linear transformations, finding their bases, rank-nullity theorem
<li>Real inner product spaces and positive (semi-)definite matrices,inner products on function spaces
<li>Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities
<li>Orthogonality, orthogonal bases, orthogonal projections, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
<li>Determinants 
<li>Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, eigenspaces and their bases
<li>Diagonalization and spectral factorization of symmetric matrices
<li>Singular Value Decomposition and applications
</ul>

via the <a href"https://library.sfsu.edu/">SFSU Library</a>. 
</ul>

<p><b>Participation.</b>
A nontrivial part of the material covered in this class will be worked out in small groups during class sessions.
It will thus be essential that every student participates actively in every class. If you have to miss a class due to a medical or family emergency, please let me know before the class; otherwise, I expect you to be in class and actively engaged.
</p>

<p><b>Homework.</b>
I will assign homework problems as we go through the material. You may (and
should) work together with your class mates. We can discuss the homework
problems at any time during class, and you can hand any of your solutions for
feedback. We will have a homework quiz every Wednesday at the beginning of class, in which you will be asked one definition and one problem given in the previous week. 
</p>

<p><b>Grading system.</b>

I want to ensure that each of you accomplishes the goals of this course as comfortably and successfully as possible. 
At any time you feel overwhelmed or lost, please come and talk with me.

<p>
<b>The math.</b>
The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
It is vital and expected that you attend every class meeting. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
Our class is based on Federico Ardila's Axioms:
<ol>
  <li>Mathematical potential is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
  <li>Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
  <li>Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
  <li>Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
</ol>

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

<p><b>Course objectives.</b>
<i>Mathematics of Optimization</i> introduces linear optimization models, their solution techniques,
and interpretation of these solutions. Specifically, students will be able to
</p>
<ul>
<li>model an optimization problem as a linear program and solve it using the simplex method;
<li>interpret the solution of the simplex algorithm in order to perform sensitivitiy
analysis;
<li>model discrete optimization problems as integer programs and solve them using cutting-plane and branch-and-bound methods.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Student Learning Outcomes.</b> 
A skeleton of what you are expected to know & do at the end of the course is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear programming models: modeling optimization problems as linear programs
<li>Geometry of linear programs: understanding the geometry of linear inequalities
<li>Simplex algorithm: using the simplex algorithm to solve linear programs
<li>Sensitivity analysis: executing sensitivity analysis of objective function coefficients
and constraint right-hand sides
<li>Dual linear programs: constructing the dual linear program
<li>Duality theorems: articulating the consequences of the strong duality and complementary
slackness theorems
<li>Integer programming methods: formulating various combinatorial optimization problems as
integer linear programs
<li>Solving integer programs: performing Gomory's cutting-plane and branch-and-bound methods
</ul>

<b>The math.</b>
The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
It is vital and expected that you attend every lecture. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
While I strongly encourage you to work together, the solutions and writing projects you hand in have to be your own.
I will assign weekly homework, each will be due the following Tuesday.<br>

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

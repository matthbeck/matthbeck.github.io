<h3><a name="dates">Important Deadlines</a></h3>
<p>are posted in the <a
href="https://webapps.sfsu.edu/public/webcal/acadcalendar">academic calendar</a>.

<h3><a name="bs">BS</a></h3>
<p>
All my classes obey the BS rule (for "baby stuff" but you're welcome to interpret this abbreviation otherwise). The rule is simple: no BS. What should be included as BS is common sense, e.g.,
<ul>
  <li>using any handheld electronic devices during class (unless you need them because of a disability, in which case please inform me),</li>
  <li>arriving late or leaving during class (if you have a medical situation that I should be aware of, please inform me),</li>
  <li>any other ways of distracting fellow students during class,</li>
  <li>handing in work late (if you need extra time for an assignment due to special circumstances, please check with me before the due date),</li>
</ul>
<p>
and the like.
The main reason for the BS rule is a good classroom/learning environment. As up-and-coming professionals in mathematics, we need to treat each other collegially and respectfully.
For some more reasons, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/opinion/leave-your-laptops-at-the-door-to-my-classroom.html">consider this</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="plagiarism">Academic integrity and plagiarism</a></h3>
<p>
<a href="http://conduct.sfsu.edu/plagiarism">Academic integrity</a> refers to the "integral" quality of the search for knowledge that a student undertakes. The work a student produces, therefore, ought to be wholly hers or his; it should result completely from the student's own efforts.
Plagiarism is a form of cheating or fraud; it occurs when a student misrepresents the work of another as his or her own. Plagiarism may consist of using the ideas, sentences, paragraphs, or the whole text of another without appropriate acknowledgment, but it also includes employing or allowing another person to write or substantially alter work that a student then submits as her or his own. Any assignment found to be plagiarized will be given an "F" grade. Instances of plagiarism may be reported to the Dean of the College, and may be reported to the University Judicial Affairs Officer for further action.
</p>
<p>
Unless stated otherwise, my students are allowed to collaborate on homework, but each of them must submit their own individual write-up. If I suspect that an individual student simply copied someone else's work, I have the right to test the student orally on their homework. If there is a discrepancy between the written and oral work, the homework grade will be altered accordingly.
</p>

<h3><a name="tutoring">Tutoring</a></h3>
<p>
There are several tutoring centers at San Francisco State. 
The <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~carp1/mathu.htm">Community Access & Retention Program</a> offers tutoring for several math classes.
</p>

<h3><a name="crncr">CR/NCR grading</a></h3>
<p>
Most Mathematics classes allow CR/NCR grading, but
many majors--including Mathematics--do not count CR/NCR
grades towards the major. Mathematics majors should
not take their Mathematics classes CR/NCR. All other
majors should check with their academic advisors
before deciding to take a Mathematics class CR/NCR.
</p>
<p>
If--after checking with your advisor--you want to
apply for CR/NCR grading, you must log onto <A HREF="https://www.sfsu.edu/online/login.htm">this web
site</A> and sign up for CR/NCR
grading before the <A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu/deptpage/acal4.htm">deadline</A>. I
will not pass out a CR/NCR sheet in class.
</p>

<h3><a name="incompletes">Incomplete grades</a></h3>
<p>
The Incomplete grade (I) is assigned only to
students doing satisfactory work until the last few
weeks of a course, when events beyond the students'
control prevented them from completing the course. If
this happens to you, discuss with me the
possibility of taking an Incomplete rather than
withdrawing from a class that you cannot finish. 
If you would like me to consider an Incomplete, be proactive: approach me as soon as you realize you will not be able to finish the class, and be prepared to present me with a plan how you intend to make up your Incomplete. 
</p>

<h3><a name="withdrawals">Late and retroactive withdrawals</a></h3>
<p>
Petitions for withdrawal from a class after the
<A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu/deptpage/acal4.htm">deadline</A>, either before the end of the
semester (late withdrawal) or after the semester ends
(retroactive withdrawal) must be justified by events
that occurred after the deadline. In general, only
petitions for withdrawal from all courses will be
approved. Late withdrawal from your math course alone
is usually not approved. 
</p>

<h3><a name="titleix">Student disclosures of sexual violence</a></h3>
<p>
SF State fosters a campus free of sexual violence including sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence,
stalking, and/or any form of sex or gender discrimination.  If you disclose a personal experience as an SF State
student, the course instructor is required to notify the Title IX Coordinator by completing the report form available
at http://titleix.sfsu.edu, emailing vpsaem@sfsu.edu or calling 338-2032.

If you disclose a personal experience as an SF State student, I am required to notify the <a href="http://titleix.sfsu.edu">Title IX Coordinator</a>.
To disclose any such violence confidentially, contact:

<h3><a name="disabilities">Students with disabilities</a></h3>
<p>
Please let me know early on if you need special assistance of any kind. 
Students with disabilities who need reasonable accommodations are encouraged to contact me.  The
Disability Programs and Resource Center (DPRC) is available to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process. The
DPRC is located in the Student Service Building and can be reached by telephone (voice/415-338-2472, video
phone/415-335-7210) or <a HREF="mailto:drc@sfsu.edu">by email</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="religious">Religious holidays</a></h3>
<p>
Reasonable accommodations will be made for you to
observe religious holidays when such observances
require you to be absent from class activities.  It is
your responsibility to inform me during
the first two weeks of class, in writing, about such
holidays.

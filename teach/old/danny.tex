<li><b>Daniel Antonetti -- Hamiltonian paths on tournaments</b><br>
A <i>tournament</i> is a directed graph G=(V,E) with n vertices,
having  one directed edge for each pair of vertices. If the n(n-1)/2
edge orientations are decided by independent tosses of a fair coin (a
<i>random tournament</i>), it is well known that h(G), the number of
Hamiltonian paths in G is a random variable with
E(h)=n!/2^{n-1}. Alon showed that
h(G)=O(n^{3/2} E(h) ) for every tournament G, and raised the question
of constructing a tournament with many Hamiltonian paths. 
Given n (odd), Danny tries to describe a tournament G=(V,E) with n vertices
that has at least Omega(n!/(2^{n-1} sqrt{n})) Hamiltonian paths.

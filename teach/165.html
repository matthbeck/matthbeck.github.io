I want to ensure that each of you accomplishes the goals of this course as comfortably and successfully as possible. 
At any time you feel overwhelmed or lost, please come and talk with me.

<p>

<b>Homework</b>: I will assign <a href="165/hw.html">homework problems</a> as we go through the material. We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class. The homework problems will be due on the Wednesday class of the following week. 
You may hand them in early to be able to correct your mistakes. Although you may (and should) work together with your class mates, the solutions you hand in have to be your own.

<p>

The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
It is vital and expected that you attend every lecture. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
The <a href="http://online.sfsu.edu">Blackboard</a> system allows you to send emails to anybody in your class. 
<a href="http://online.sfsu.edu">Blackboard</a> also features an online discussion board.
Contact each other and work together. 

<p>

<b>Term paper</b>: This is a project you will be working on throughout the semester. The topic is up to you but needs to be checked with me. Topics could be anything from the history of a mathematical concept to a current issue in math education. <a href="165/termpaper.html">Here is a list of possible topics</a>, but you should feel free to come up with your own ideas. I expect that you will have found a topic by the end of February. A first draft is due on April 6. You will correct each other's drafts; the corrections are due on April 16. The final version of your paper is due on May 16, the last day of classes. As with your homework, you may hand in your paper early to be able to get feedback from me.

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

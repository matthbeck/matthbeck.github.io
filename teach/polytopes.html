Polytopes are the natural generalizations of line segments and polygons to higher dimensions.
Examples of polytopes in three dimensions include crystals, boxes,
tetrahedra, and any convex object whose faces are all flat.  
One way to define a polytope is to consider the <i>convex hull</i> of a
finite collection of points in Euclidean space <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>.  That is,
suppose someone gives us a set of points v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub> in
<b>R</b><sup>d</sup>. The polytope determined by the given points v<sub>j</sub> is
defined by all linear combinations c<sub>1</sub>v<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub>v<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>n</sub>v<sub>n</sub>,
where the coefficients c<sub>j</sub> are nonnegative real numbers that
satisfy the relation c<sub>1</sub> + c<sub>2</sub> + ... + c<sub>n</sub> = 1. This construction is
called the <i>vertex description</i> of the polytope.  

<p>

There is
another equivalent definition, called the <i>hyperplane
description</i> of the polytope. Namely, if someone hands us the
linear inequalities that define a finite collection of half-spaces
in <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>, we can define the associated polytope as the
simultaneous intersection of the half-spaces defined by the given
inequalities.

<p>

It is amusing to see how many problems in combinatorics, 
number theory, and many other mathematical areas 
can be recast in the language of  polytopes that
exist in some Euclidean space. Conversely, the versatile structure
of polytopes gives us number-theoretic and combinatorial
information that flows naturally from their geometry.

<p>

Our goal in this seminar is to understand the combinatorial structure of polytopes. We will start by proving the equivalence of the two descriptions of polytopes given above and then proceed to think about questions such as 'which polytopes have the maximal number of faces given a fixed dimension and number of vertices (extreme points)?'

<b>Evaluation of Students</b>:
This is a seminar course, that is, <a href="polytopes/schedule.html">the students will present the material</a>, in approximately two lectures at a time. I will also assign some (very light) homework each week.
Students will be graded on their lectures, homework assignments, and class participation.

<p>

The <a HREF="seminar.html">SFSU Algebra-Geometry-Combinatorics Seminar</a> hosts many leading experts on polytopes. The seminar meets Fridays at 3:10.

"Philosophy is written in this grand book--I mean the universe--which stands continually open to our glaze, 
but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters 
in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, 
circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it."

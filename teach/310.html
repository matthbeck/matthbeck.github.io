Number Theory studies the <i>integers</i>: numbers like 0, 1, -3, 34, ... which we have been used to since childhood. A fundamental concept is that of <i>divisibility</i>: the integer <i>a</i> divides the integer <i>b</i> if we can find an integer <i>c</i> such that <i>b=ac</i>. This simple concept gives rise to a beautiful theory, encryptions schemes which are used on any computer today, and many famous open problems in mathematics, among other things.

<p>

As an example, we will consider <i>prime numbers</i>: those integers >1 that are only divisible by themselves and 1. There are <i>infinitely</i> many prime numbers, one of the many theorems we will prove in this course.
The only even prime is 2, all others are odd. To say this in a more sophisticated way: there are infinitely many primes that give 1 as a remainder when we divide them by 2.
Can one say something similar when we divide primes by 3? The only prime that does not give a remainder when divided by 3 is 3 itself. So all others give a remainder of 1 or 2. Are there infinitely many primes in both cases?
To give an open problem, we mention <i>twin primes</i>: those are pairs of primes that differ by 2. Are there infinitely many twin primes?

<p>

Topics in this course will include:

<ul>
<li>Divisibility
<li>Primes
<li>Congruences
<li>Arithmetic functions
<li>Primitive roots
<li>Quadratic reciprocity
<li>Continued fractions
</ul>

<p>

I want to ensure that each of you accomplishes the goals of this course as comfortably and successfully as possible. 
At any time you feel overwhelmed or lost, please come and talk with me.

<p>

<b>Homework</b>: I will <a href="310/hw.html">assign homework problems</a> as we go through the material. We can discuss the homework problems at any time during class. All homework assignments of a given week have to be handed in by the start of the Friday class of the following week. 
You may hand in some of your problems early to be able to correct your mistakes. Although you may (and should) work together with your class mates, the solutions you hand in have to be your own.

<p>

<b>Quizzes</b>: I will frequently check your progress through unannounced quizzes given at the beginning of class. A quiz will typically test your concept of a certain definition or statement. There will be no make-up quizzes. At the end of the semester, I will drop the lowest of your quiz grades.

<p>

The way to <i>learn</i> math is through <i>doing</i> math. 
It is vital and expected that you attend every lecture. You will get
a good feel for the math from there, but it is even more crucial that you do the 
homework. Working in groups is not only allowed but strongly recommended. 
The <a href="http://online.sfsu.edu">Blackboard</a> system allows you to send emails to anybody in your class. Contact each other and work together.

This syllabus is subject to change. 
All assignments, as well as other announcements on tests, policies, etc.,
are given in class. If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to find
out what's going on. I will try to keep this course web page as updated as
possible, however, the most recent information will always be given in class. 
Always ask lots of questions in class; my courses are interactive. 
You are always encouraged to see me in my office.

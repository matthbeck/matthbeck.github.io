<b><a name="tutoring">Tutoring</a></b>
<p>

There are several tutoring centers at San Francisco State. 
The <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~lac/math.htm">Learning Assistance Center</a> offers tutoring for several math classes, as does the <a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~carp1/mathu.htm">Community Access & Retention Program</a>.
The Math Department also runs a <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/schuster/tutoring.html">tutoring center</a> in Thornton Hall.

<b><a name="plagiarism">Academic Integrity and Plagiarism</a></b>
<p>

<a href="http://www.sfsu.edu/~helpdesk/docs/rules/conduct.htm">Academic integrity</a> refers to the "integral" quality of the search for knowledge that a student undertakes. The work a student produces, therefore, ought to be wholly hers or his; it should result completely from the student's own efforts.
Plagiarism is a form of cheating or fraud; it occurs when a student misrepresents the work of another as his or her own. Plagiarism may consist of using the ideas, sentences, paragraphs, or the whole text of another without appropriate acknowledgment, but it also includes employing or allowing another person to write or substantially alter work that a student then submits as her or his own. Any assignment found to be plagiarized will be given an "F" grade. Instances of plagiarism may be reported to the Dean of the College, and may be reported to the University Judicial Affairs Officer for further action.

<b><a name="crncr">CR/NCR grading</a></b>
<p>

Most Mathematics classes allow CR/NCR grading, but
many majors--including Mathematics--do not count CR/NCR
grades towards the major. Mathematics majors should
not take their Mathematics classes CR/NCR. All other
majors should check with their academic advisors
before deciding to take a Mathematics class CR/NCR.

If--after checking with your advisor--you want to
apply for CR/NCR grading, you must log onto <A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu/student">this web
site</A> and sign up for CR/NCR
grading before the <A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu/deptpage/acal4.htm">deadline</A>. I
will not pass out a CR/NCR sheet in class.

<p><br>
<b><a name="incompletes">Incomplete grades</a></b>
<p>

The Incomplete grade (I) is assigned only to
students doing satisfactory work until the last few
weeks of a course, when events beyond the students'
control prevented them from completing the course. If
this happens to you, discuss with me the
possibility of taking an Incomplete rather than
withdrawing from a class that you cannot finish. 

Incompletes must be made up within twelve months of
the date they are assigned. I will tell
you how to make up your incomplete. Do not enroll in
the same course again. You can only take a course
once. 

<p><br>
<b><a name="withdrawals">Late and retroactive withdrawals</a></b>
<p>

Petitions for withdrawal from a class after the
<A HREF="http://www.sfsu.edu/deptpage/acal4.htm">deadline</A>, either before the end of the
semester (late withdrawal) or after the semester ends
(retroactive withdrawal) must be justified by events
that occurred after the deadline. In general, only
petitions for withdrawal from all courses will be
approved. Late withdrawal from your math course alone
is usually not approved. 

<p><br>
<b><a name="disabilities">Students with disabilities</a></b>
<p>

Please let me know early on if you need special assistance of any kind. 
Students with disabilities needing reasonable
accommodations must bring an official written request
to me from the Disability Programs and
Resource Center (Student Services Building, Room 110,
(415) 338-1041, <a HREF="mailto:drc@sfsu.edu">drc@sfsu.edu</a>). 
The DPRC is available
to facilitate the reasonable accommodations process.

<p><br>
<b><a name="religious">Religious holidays</a></b>
<p>

Reasonable accommodations will be made for you to
observe religious holidays when such observances
require you to be absent from class activities.  It is
your responsibility to inform me during
the first two weeks of class, in writing, about such
holidays.

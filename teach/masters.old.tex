<li><b>Partition functions for the exceptional root systems</b><br>
<i>Root systems</i> originated in the study of reflections groups and have a wide variety of applications in Representation Theory, Geometry, Number Theory, Combinatorics, Physics, etc. etc. There are certain counting functions, the <i>vector partition functions</i>, attached in a natural way to a root system. (Vector partition functions are multivariate analogs of Ehrhart polynomials, which were mentioned above.) The computation of theses counting functions is both hard and of interest to many mathematicians. There exist recently-developed algorithms (see <A HREF="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CO/0504231">arXiv:math.CO/0504231</a>) for the so-called <i>classical</i> root systems. Extend these algorithms to the <i>exceptional</i> root systems.

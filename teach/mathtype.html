<H2>Math typesetting programs</H2>
</center>

<p><br>

There is a variety of programs used for mathematical typesetting. A few are listed here (if you know of a program that is not included here, please <a HREF="mailto:beck@math.sfsu.edu">let me know</a>).

<p><br>
<b>Equation Editors</b>
<p>

Most word processing programs come with a small add-on that allows you to display mathematical symbols and equations.

<p><br>
<b><a HREF="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/">MathType</a></b>
<p>

This is a fancy version of the equation editor that comes with Microsoft Word. MathType is supposed to be installed on many campus computers, including the ones in the Math Department's computer pod. Students who would like to use MathType on their home computer (Mac or Windows) can get the SFSU password <a HREF="mailto:beck@math.sfsu.edu">from me</a>.

<p><br>
<b><a HREF="http://www.mackichan.com/">Scientific Workplace</a></b>
<p>

This is not (as their advertisement states) "the gold standard for mathematical publishing", but it comes pretty close. Scientific Workplace features more options than word processing editors and has a small computer algebra system built in. SFSU does not have a Scientific Workplace license, however MacKichan allows you to download a free trial version.

<b><a HREF="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a></b>
<p>

This is the queen of mathematical typesetting programs. The typeset quality of a TeXed document matches that of a (good) math book in print. LaTeX is clumsier to handle at first, compared to the above plug-and-play programs; it is a document preparation system rather than a word processor. At any rate, once one is used to some basic commands, TeXing is as fast as any word processor, and the outcome is in another dimension...
A nice introduction to the LaTeX structure and commands can be found <a href="http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/">here</a>.

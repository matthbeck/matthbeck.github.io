"It is an important and popular fact that things are not always as what they seem. For instance, on the planet earth, man has always assumed that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much: the wheel, New York, wars. [...] But conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than men; for precisely the same reasons."

"You can only be truly accomplished at something you love. Don't make money 
the goal. Instead, pursue the things you love doing, and do them so well that 
people can't take their eyes off you. All the other tangible rewards will come 
as a result." 
<br>Maya Angleou

<p> 
"Combinatorial analysis, in the trivial sense of manipulating binomial and multinomial coefficients, and formally expanding powers of infinite series by applications ad libitum and ad nauseamque of the multinomial theorem, represented the best that academic mathematics could do in the Germany of the late 18th century." 
<br>
"If things are nice there is probably a good reason why they are nice: and if you do
       not know at least one reason for this good fortune, then you still have work to do."

"In the broad light of day mathematicians check their equations and their proofs, leaving no stone
unturned in their search for rigour. But, at night, under the full moon, they dream, they float
among the stars and wonder at the miracle of the heavens. They are inspired. Without dreams there
is no art, no mathematics, no life."
<br>Michael Atiya (<i>Notices of the AMS</i>, 2010)
<p>
"Spending time with math people is a lot of fun. As a result of the play, I've had semi-drunken dinners with mathematicians all over the country. I recommend the experience."

"Life is the twofold internal movement of composition and decomposition at
once general and continuous."
<br>Henri de Blainville (<i>American Journal of the Medical Sciences</i>,
1858)
<p>
"There are two versions of math in the lives of many Americans: the strange and boring subject that they encountered in classrooms and an interesting set of ideas that is the math of the world, and is curiously different and surprisingly engaging. Our task is to introduce this second version to today's students, get them excited about math, and prepare them for the future."

<p> 
"5 out of 4 people have trouble with fractions."

"Suppose that you want to teach the 'cat' concept to a very young child. Do you explain that a cat is a relatively 
small, primarily carnivorous mammal with retractible claws, a distinctive sonic output, etc.? I'll bet not. You 
probably show the kid a lot of different cats, saying 'kitty' each time, until it gets the idea. To put it more 
generally, generalizations are best made by abstraction from experience." 
<br>R. P. Boas (<i>Can we make mathematics inelligible?</i>, American Mathematical Monthly 88 (1981), pp. 727-731)
<p>
"We all agree that your theory is crazy, but is it crazy enough?"

"There are three kinds of people: those who can count and those who can't." 
<br>Bumpersticker on a car in Ithaca, NY 
<p>
"Abstraction consists essentially in the creation and utilization of ambiguity." 
<br>"Logic moves in one direction, the direction of clarity, coherence and structure. Ambiguity moves in the other direction, that of fluidity, openness, and release. Mathematics moves back and forth between these two poles. [...] It is the interaction between these different aspects that gives mathematics its power." 
<br>William Byers (<i>How Mathematicians Think</i>, Princeton University Press, 2007) 
<p>
"Too many people are thinking of security instead of opportunity. They seem more afraid of life than death."
<br>James F. Byrnes

"Alice laughed: 'There's no use trying,' she said; 'one can't believe impossible things.' 
'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was younger, I always did it for
half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.' "
<br>
"Where shall I begin" he asked. "Begin at the beginning", the king said, "and stop when you get to an end." 
<br>
"And what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"
<br>Lewis Carroll (<i>Alice in Wonderland</i>) 
<p>
"The peculiar interest of magic squares and all <i>lusus numerorum</i> in general lies in 
the fact that they possess the charm of mystery. They appear to betray some hidden 
intelligence which by a preconceived plan produces the impression of intentional design, 
a phenomenon which finds its close analogue in nature."
<br>Paul Carus (in W. S. Andrews, <i>Magic Squares and Cubes</i>, 1960)  
<p>
"First, it is necessary to study the facts, to multiply the number of observations, and then later to search for 
formulas that connect them so as thus to discern the particular laws governing a certain class of phenomena. 
In general, it is not until after these particular laws have been established that one can expect to discover 
and articulate the more general laws that complete theories by bringing a multitude of apparently very diverse 
phenomena together under a single governing principle." 
<br>Augustin Louis Cauchy (1789-1857) 
<p>
"To make a great dream come true, the first requirement is a great capacity to dream; the second is persistence."

"Everyone engaged in research must have had the experience of working with 
feverish and prolonged intensity to write a paper which no one else will 
read or to solve a problem which no one else thinks important and which 
will bring no conceivable reward -- which may only confirm a general 
opinion that the researcher is wasting his time on irrelevancies."
<br><a href="http://www.chomsky.info/">Noam Chomsky</a> (<i>A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior</i>, Language, 35, No. 1 (1959), 26-58)

"I saw, as one might see the transit of Venus, a quantity passing through infinity and changing its sign 
from plus to minus. I saw exactly how it happened... but it was after dinner and I let it go." 
<br>Winston Churchill (<i>My early life</i>, 1930) 
<p>
"11:15 Restate my assumptions: 
<br>1. Mathematics is the language of nature. 
<br>2. Everything around us can be represented and understood through numbers. 
<br>3. If you graph these numbers, patterns emerge. Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature." 
<br>Max Cohen (played by Sean Gullette, in <i>Pi</i>, a film by Darren Aronofsky) 
<p>
"To many, mathematics is a collection of theorems. For me, mathematics is a collection of examples; a theorem is a statement about a collection of examples and the purpose of proving theorems is to classify and explain the examples..."

<p>
"I hate algebra." 
<br>John H. Conway (Invited AMS address, Toronto, 9/23/00)

<br>Mariana Cook (in the preface of her book <i>Mathematicians: An Outer View of the Inner World</i> with Clifford Gunning, Princeton University Press, 2009).
<p>
"The mathematical phenomenon always develops out of simple arithmetic, so useful in everyday 
life, out of numbers, those weapons of the gods: the gods are there, behind the wall, at play 
with numbers." 
<br>Le Corbusier 
<p>
"A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there." 
<br>Charles R. Darwin 
<p> 
"Je serais reconnaissant a toute personne ayant compris cette demonstration de me l'expliquer."
<br>"From [Grothendieck], I have also learned not to take glory in the difficulty of a proof: difficulty means we have not understood. The idea is to be able to paint a
landscape in which the proof is obvious."
<br>Pierre Deligne (<i>Theorie des topos et cohomologie etale des schemas, Tome 3</i>, p. 584, and <i>Notices of the AMS</i> 63 (2016), p. 250)

<p>
"I certainly do care about measuring educational results. But what is an 'educational result?' The twinkling eyes of my students, together with their heartfelt and beautifully expressed mathematical arguments are all the results I need."

<p>

<p>
"Suppose that we think of the integers lined up like dominoes. The inductive step tells us that they are close enough for each domino to knock over the next one, the base case tells us that the first domino falls over, the conclusion is that they all fall over. The fault in this analogy is that it takes time for each domino to fall and so a domino which is a long way along the line won't fall over for a long time. Mathematical implication is outside time."
<br>Peter J. Eccles (<i>An Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning</i>, p. 41)
<p>
"I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."

the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong." 
<br>
"Everything you've learned in school as 'obvious' becomes less
and less obvious as you begin to study the universe. For
example, there are no solids in the universe. There's not even
a suggestion of a solid. There are no absolute continuums.
There are no surfaces. There are no straight lines."
<br>Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) 
<p> 
"When people tell you something's wrong or doesn't work for them, they are almost always right.
When they tell you exactly what they think is wrong and how to fix it, they are almost always
wrong."
<br>Neil Gaiman
<p> 
"Philosophy is written in this grand book--I mean the universe--which stands continually open to our gaze, 
but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters 
in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, 
circles, and other geometric figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it."

"The fact that we're humans is really pretty limiting. I mean, we didn't evolve to
understand the structure of the space-time continuum or do things in 100,000 dimensions. We

"One of the big misapprehensions about mathematics that we perpetrate in our classrooms is that the
 teacher always seems to know the answer to any problem that is discussed. This gives students the
 idea that there is a book somewhere with all the right answers to all of the interesting questions, and
 that teachers know those answers. And if one could get hold of the book, one would have everything
                   settled. That's so unlike the true nature of mathematics."

"Mathematical study and research are very suggestive of mountaineering. Whymper made several efforts before he

      hauled up for a small cost, and perhaps does not appreciate the difficulty of the original ascent. So in mathematics, it
      may be found hard to realise the great initial difficulty of making a little step which now seems so natural and obvious,

'I mean,' he said, ' so <i>what</i> if there exists a set of sets that are not members of themselves, which makes it a set that both is and isn't a member of itself?' 'But Owen, dear,' Phyllis said, 'the antinomies--the paradoxes--undermine classical logic, but the way they have to be phrased brings us to symbolic logic, which brings in Boolean math and the Turing machine and algorithms.

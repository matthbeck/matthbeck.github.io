The ``tropical product" of two real numbers is their usual sum, while
the ``tropical sum" is their minimum.  This formalism establishes
a link between piecewise-linear functions and subtraction-free rational
expressions. Its first uses in the 1970's were in control
theory and combinatorial optimization. We will discuss two recent
applications of a completely different kind:
<p>
1) expressing tensor product multiplicities for semisimple groups as
numbers of lattice points in some convex polytopes; and
<p>
2) proving Alexey Zamolodchikov's periodicity conjecture for Y-systems
arising in thermodynamic Bethe ansatz.
<p>
The talk will be elementary and will require practically no background
from representation theory or physics.

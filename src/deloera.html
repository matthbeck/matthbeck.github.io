<p>
A wide variety of problems in pure and applied mathematics involve the
problem of counting the number of lattice points inside a region in space.
Applications range from the very pure (Number theory, Toric Hilbert
functions, Kostant's partition function in representation theory, Ehrhart
polynomials in combinatorics) to the very applied (cryptography, integer
programming, statistical contingency tables, Mass-spectroscopy analysis).

Perhaps the most basic case is when the region is a convex bounded
polyhedron. In the 1990's, new ideas from toric algebraic geometry by M.
Brion, A. Khovanskii and others led A. Barvinok to propose rational
generating functions as the ideal data structure for representing lattice
points. In 1993 he constructed an elegant polynomial time algorithm when
the dimension of a polytope is fixed. Today, further developments by Beck,
Baldoni-Silva, Lasserre, Pixton, Vergne, Sturmfels, Szenes, and others
show that algebraic-analytic ideas are highly effective and practical
computer software (e.g. LattE) allows us to consider old unsolved
questions about lattices and polyhedra. This talk is a survey of this
exciting area of computational mathematics.

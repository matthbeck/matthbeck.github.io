<b>Lattice reformulation of integer programming problems</b>
<p>
I will discuss how to use the structure of lattices to reformulate
and solve integer programming problems. I will take a closer look at
integer knapsack problems and show how it is possible to use the
structure of lattices to prove properties of certain classes of
knapsack problems, and how these properties can be used in designing
practically efficient algorithms.

<b>Efficient integer point counting in large dimensions</b>
<p>
I am planning to discuss some approaches to efficient (polynomial time)
counting of integer points in rational polytopes where the dimension
of the polytope is allowed to be large. The computational
complexity of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial will be discussed as well
as probabilistic approaches to approximate counting. One of the central
examples is the transportation polytope of non-negative integer matrices
with prescribed row and column sums.

<b>Importance sampling versus Markov chains; a survey </b>
<p>
Sequential importance sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo are both applicable to counting and random generation in lattice point problems. Each has strengths and weaknesses. I will review these for a wide variety of problems, focusing on theory and counter-examples.

<b>Rational functions associated to the classical groups</b>
<p>
Given an element w of Z<sup>n</sup>, with all components different,
we define three rational functions corresponding to
the simple roots of the classical groups of type A, B, D.

More precisely, one defines:
<center>
phi<sup>A</sup>(w) := 1/(-x<sub>w_1</sub>+x<sub>w_2</sub>)(-x<sub>w_2</sub>+x<sub>w_3</sub>)<sup>...</sup>(-x<sub>w_{n-1}</sub>+x<sub>w_n</sub>)
<br>
phi<sup>B</sup>(w) := 1/(x<sub>w_1</sub>(-x<sub>w_1</sub>+x<sub>w_2</sub>)(-x<sub>w_2</sub>+x<sub>w_3</sub>)<sup>...</sup>(-x<sub>w_{n-1}</sub>+x<sub>w_n</sub>))
<br>
phi<sup>D</sup>(w) := 1/(-x<sub>w_1</sub><sup>2</sup>+x<sub>w_2</sub><sup>2</sup>)(-x<sub>w_2</sub>+x<sub>w_3</sub>)<sup>...</sup>(-x<sub>w_{n-1}</sub>+x<sub>w_n</sub>)
</center>

It is easy to check that the sums phi<sup>A</sup>(w), phi<sup>B</sup>(w), phi<sup>D</sup>(w) on the full group (of respective type A, B, D) are null.

More generally, one sums these functions on initial intervals
(for the weak order), i.e. on intervals between the identity
and a given element of the group.

We characterize the intervals which give a zero sum.
We moreover give natural  bases of each of the vector spaces
generated by phi<sup>X</sup>(w), w in W<sub>X</sub> (X=A<sup>n</sup>, B<sup>n</sup>, D<sup>n</sup>).

For example, in the case of type A, the permutations fixing 1 furnish a basis.

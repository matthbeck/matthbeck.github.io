Given a triangulation of a lattice polytope, one can reduce the question
of counting lattice points in the polytope to that of counting lattice
points in the individual simplices. In the toric variety setting, this
corresponds to a degeneration of the toric variety to a ``toric
simplicial complex''. Amazingly, the work of Littelmann and Chirivi
give a degeneration of each flag manifold to a toric simplicial complex,
giving multiplicity formulae again in terms of counting lattice points
in simplices. I'll explain a common framework that produces both of
these degenerations, and should lead to many others.
